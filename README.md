# UNP_PYTHON_PROJECT_HEALTH-INSURANCE-DATASET
Description -This project utilizes machine learning techniques to predict annual medical insurance premiums based on customer data, enabling better decision-making for both insurers and policyholders. A dataset with seven variables, including age, BMI, smoker status, and region, was analyzed through preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and feature engineering. Models like Linear Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors, and Decision Tree were implemented, with Linear Regression achieving the best performance (RÂ² = 0.747). The project provides insights into the factors affecting premiums and builds a predictive model to enhance pricing accuracy. It highlights the potential of data-driven approaches in optimizing health insurance strategies.
